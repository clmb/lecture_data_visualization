Welcome! 

These are the lecture notes of the course ''Data Visualization - From a Human-Centered Perspective'' in the winter term 2021/22. It is a very first draft and I expect many mistakes, however, it is a start and I am looking forward receiving your comments and ideas for suggestions. 

This course gives students an introduction to the fundamentals of data visualization with current insights from research and practice.
