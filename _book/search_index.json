This challenge affects many areas of life today, such as research, business, and politics. In these contexts, decision-makers use data visualizations to explain information and its relationships through graphical representations of data. This course aims to familiarize students with the principles, techniques, and methods in data visualization and provide practical skills for designing and implementing data visualizations. The master course «data visualization» is intended for students interested in better understanding how to critically engage with data visualization and how to design effective data visualizations reflectively. Basic knowledge of programming (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python) and data analysis (e.g., R) is helpful. In addition to participating in class discussions, students will complete several programming and data analysis assignments. In a mini-project, students work on a given problem. Finally, we expect students to document and present their assignments and mini-project in a reproducible manner. Please note that the course will focus on how data is visually coded and presented for analysis after the data structure and its meaning are known. We do not explicitly cover exploratory analysis methods for discovering insights in data. Text Book This course is highly influenced bu the work of Tamara Munzner and her book (Visualization Analysis &amp; Design)[https://www.routledge.com/Visualization-Analysis-and-Design/Munzner/p/book/9781466508910]. In our hand library, there are exemplars available. Learning Goals &amp; Objectives This course gives students a solid introduction to the fundamentals of data visualization with current insights from research and practice. By the end of the course, students will be able to select and apply methods for designing visualizations based on a problem, know essential theoretical basics of visualization for graphical perception and cognition, know and to select visualization approaches and their advantages and disadvantages, evaluate visualization solutions critically, and have acquired practical skills for implementing visualizations.

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2021) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
